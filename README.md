##  To make a mathematical library for evolutionary algorithms
### 1. operations with complex numbers -- This works already
  tables to define complex numbers that support the operations sum, difference, multiplication, 
  division, power, conjugate, absolute. With    a module called mathSci with common functions, all for complex numbers.
### 2. integration and numerically derived -- This works already
I want to implement all available integration methods, 
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration
For differential calculation, i use the Cauchy integral formula
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_integral_formula
### 3.  Numerical Methods for Differential Equations -- NEXT STEP
### 4.  matrix and vector operations -- a future step
### 5.  symbolic expressions -- a future step
### 6. to plot graphics in an image file -- nothing very good, but promising


##   Send me a pull request. I'll need help, thank you.
