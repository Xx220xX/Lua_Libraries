#  to make a mathematical library for evolutionary algorithms
# 1 - operations with complex numbers -- This works already
# 2 - integration and numerically derived -- This works already
# 3 - Numerical Methods for Differential Equations -- NEXT STEP
# 4 - matrix and vector operations -- a future step
# 5 - symbolic expressions -- a future step
# 6 - to plot graphics in an image file -- nothing very good, but promising


#   Send me a pull request. I'll need help, thank you.
